# fastai-projects
Jupyter notebooks that use the Fastai library

## fastai v1.0

### Data Augmentation by fastai v1
The jupyter notebook data-augmentation-by-fastai-v1.ipynb (https://github.com/piegu/fastai-projects/blob/master/data-augmentation-by-fastai-v1.ipynb) presents the code to apply transformations on images with fastai v1.

### Pretrained ImageNet Classifier by fastai v1
The objective of the jupyter notebook pretrained-imagenet-classifier-fastai-v1.ipynb (https://github.com/piegu/fastai-projects/blob/master/pretrained-imagenet-classifier-fastai-v1.ipynb) is to use fastai v1 instead of Pytorch code in order to classify images into 1000 classes by using an ImageNet winner model.

### ImageNet Classifier Web App
It is an images classifier (https://github.com/piegu/fastai-projects/blob/master/Web-Apps/ImageNet-Classifier/README.md) that use the Deep Learning model resnet (the resnet50 version) that won the ImageNet competition in 2015 (ILSVRC2015). It classifies an image into 1000 categories.

## fastai version BEFORE v1.0
