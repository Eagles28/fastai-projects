#  ImageNet Classifier Web App

The Web app described here is online at https://imagenet.onrender.com/

It is an images classifier that use the Deep Learning model [resnet152](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html#torchvision.models.resnet152) that won the ImageNet competition in 2015 ([ILSVRC2015](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/)). 

It can classify an image into 1000 categories ([list in the ImageNet Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/data)).
